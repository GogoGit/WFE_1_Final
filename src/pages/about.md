## About Me

My Name is Kevin McClean from the clan McClean of the low hills of Jamaica.

If you can sus out where I got that from, you can roughly tell how old I am and where a lot of my child hood references come from.

I'm a transplant and I live in Queens, where like Eddie Murphy in the movie Coming to America, I found my Queen and I'm living my best life.

Currenlty I'm the Senior Systems Administrator at the College of Nursing and below are some random things about me:

I make homemade ice cream
I like to build things
I play lots of games. Board games, Table top games, Video games and sometimes word games
As a child, i didn't like to read, but I do now!
If I've piqued your interest come and check out my blog!
