## About Me

My Name is Kevin McClean from the clan McClean of the low hills of Jamaica.

If you can sus out where I got that from, you can roughly tell how old I am and where a lot of my child hood references come from.

I'm a transplant and I live in Queens, where like Eddie Murphy in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094898/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coming to America</a>, I found my Queen while living my best life.

Currenlty I'm the Senior Systems Administrator at the College of Nursing and below are some random things about me:

- I make homemade ice cream
- I like to build things
- I play lots of games. Board games, Table top games, Video games and sometimes word games
- As a child, i didn't like to read, but I do now!
- If I've piqued your interest come and check out my blog!
