    Now it's a variable :)
    check out the nav section in _includes\layout.html

Note you can create your own variables their too, look at pictures.md

singleImage: /img/apples.png
images:
  - apples.png
  - apples-red.png
  - apples-group.png

    singleImage:  is a single image
    images is an array

pageClass: [Name]

This is how you create a class in the <body> where you can apply special css rules



*** _data  (Globally avialable)
    filename.json

    > so data will be available as filename.[data in json file]
